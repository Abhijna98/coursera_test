		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h3 id="J">Joey Tribianni</h3><p>Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his "ladies man" personality, he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing video games and foosball, loves sandwiches and pizza, and is a big fan of Baywatch. As a struggling actor, he is constantly looking for work. He was ordained as a minister in "The One with the Truth About London" and officiated at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings.</p></div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h3 id="P">Phoebe Buffay</h3><p>Phoebe Buffay is a fictional character, portrayed by Lisa Kudrow, one of the six main characters from the American sitcom Friends, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman. She was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank Buffay and Lily Buffay. Her birth-mother's name was Phoebe Abbott. She has a twin sister named Ursula Buffay, who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She appeared in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere on September 24, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. She is a masseuse and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. </p></div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"><h3 id="C">Chandler Bing</h3><p>Chandler's best friend is Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), who is his roommate. He previously lived with his good friend Ross Geller (David Schwimmer). He met Ross' sister, Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and her friend, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross' love for Rachel. He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a defense mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a child. </p></div>
